# Requirements

 ## Introduction
A sample C programming code for a real time calculator application program is given below. This program will perform the below calculator operations.
In this projects, we will learn to create a simple calculator in C programming using the switch statement.

To understand this project, we should have the knowledge of the following C programming topics:

C switch Statement
C break and continue


### Advantages

 - Improved engagement with the calculations
 - Easy and faster access 
 - Better, longer-lasting customer relationships
 - Increased productivity with relaxation
 - No need of more memory for storage 
 - Random values generation makes our calculating more interesting.

 
## Cost and Features
 - Complexity 
 - Random Function values generation
 - Finding the sum of the any numbers individually
 

##  Defining our system:

# 4 W's and 1 H

## Who
Every calculating  with electrnic devices need calculator now a days.

## What
A  calculator where we can calculate with each other almost like real calculator.

## When

Due to when the load in history sitations, basic functions and exponenets calculate basic fintions such as add,sum,mult,divided

## Where

It on the display or a result in our list of past calculations.

## How

This application was developed in C language to avoid the complexity and to keep it simple.
